# Tower-Defense-3D

How do I run the game?  
Just open Tower Defense 3D\Visual Studio\Framework_EGC.sln in Visual Studio.  

How do I play it?  
The enemies move in z-shape and they will come from the upper left corner to the lower right corner. Your job is to defend the base and kill all of them.  
You have 3 towers that will help you during the game. If an enemy approaches in their range they will start shooting towards him.  
You have 3 lives represented by the spheres that are orbiting around you. If 3 enemies are entering into the base you will lose.
